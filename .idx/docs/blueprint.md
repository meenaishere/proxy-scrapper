# **App Name**: Proxy Phantom

## Core Features:

- Proxy Scraper: Continuously scrapes publicly available sources for Indian proxy server addresses.
- Proxy Validator: Validates proxies by checking their connectivity and Indian origin before they can be added to the active proxy pool. A testing tool checks location.
- Proxy Delivery: Provides a `/get_proxy` endpoint to deliver a single, validated, and functional Indian proxy.
- Error Handling: Gracefully handles errors related to proxy unavailability, validation failures, or scraping issues, logging errors for debugging purposes.

## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal gray (#333333) for a stealthy terminal look.
- Primary color: Bright green (#32CD32) to indicate status and activity.
- Accent color: Saffron (#FF9933) to highlight Indian origin or special indicators.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for all text elements.
